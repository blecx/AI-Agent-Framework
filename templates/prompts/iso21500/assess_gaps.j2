You are conducting a gap assessment for project "{{ project_key }}" following ISO 21500 project management standards.

The project currently has the following artifacts:
{% if present_artifacts %}
{% for artifact in present_artifacts %}
- {{ artifact }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- None
{% endif %}

The following required ISO 21500 artifacts are missing:
{% if missing_artifacts %}
{% for artifact in missing_artifacts %}
- {{ artifact }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- None (all required artifacts are present)
{% endif %}

Please analyze:
1. The impact of missing artifacts on project management effectiveness
2. Priority order for creating missing artifacts
3. Any dependencies between artifacts that should influence the creation order
4. Specific risks associated with the current gaps

Provide a concise analysis suitable for a gap assessment report.
