# Project Constitution

## Purpose

Build a robust AI-agent-driven product development system with Spec-Driven Development compatibility.

## Core Governance

1. Spec-first delivery: use spec → plan → tasks → implement flow for feature work.
2. UX authority rule: all graphical UX/navigation decisions must be reviewed by `blecs-ux-authority`.
3. Workflow authority rule: workflow constraints are normalized by `blecs-workflow-authority`.
4. Validation evidence is mandatory for PR acceptance.
