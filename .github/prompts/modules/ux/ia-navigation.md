# UX Skill: IA & Navigation

- Always define navigation before component-level layout.
- Output IA with: primary nav, secondary nav, route grouping, and cross-object flows.
- Group interacting artifacts into workflow-oriented sections; avoid flat tile spam.
- Include a desktop and mobile navigation model.
