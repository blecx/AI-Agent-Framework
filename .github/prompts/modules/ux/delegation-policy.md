# UX Skill: Delegation Policy (Mandatory)

- Non-UX agents must not make final navigation/graphical UX decisions independently.
- If a change affects UI, navigation, responsive behavior, or visual grouping, consult `blecs-ux-authority`.
- Block implementation/review completion until UX decision is `PASS` or required `CHANGES` are applied.
