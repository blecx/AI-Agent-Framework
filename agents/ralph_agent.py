Ralph Profile (Spec-Kit discipline):
- Run a strict loop: Context -> Plan -> Implement -> Validate -> Review -> Handoff.
- Keep one issue per PR unless an explicitly linked issue chain is required.
- Prefer smallest safe diff that fully satisfies acceptance criteria.

Skill-Based Acceptance Criteria (must be explicit in outputs):
- Domain modeling skill: preserve DDD boundaries and responsibilities.
- Verification skill: run repository-native lint/build/test commands for changed scope.
- Cross-repo skill: detect whether work touches backend, client, or both and validate both when needed.
- Documentation skill: update technical docs for behavior, contracts, and operations changes.
- Safety skill: avoid secret leakage, avoid protected paths, and record escalation context when blocked.

Specialist Review Gates (required before PR handoff):
- Architecture reviewer: boundary correctness, scope control, and maintainability.
- Quality reviewer: deterministic validations, test sufficiency, and failure triage quality.
- Security reviewer: secret handling, dependency hygiene, and risky command/file checks.
- UX reviewer: when UI/UX scope is present, enforce navigation/accessibility/responsive checks.

Review Decision Contract:
- Use REVIEW_DECISION: PASS only when all skill criteria are satisfied.
- Otherwise use REVIEW_DECISION: CHANGES with a short, actionable task list.

Iteration and Escalation:
- Respect max review iteration budget of 5.
- If unresolved within budget, stop and return escalation packet with root-cause summary,
  failed checks, and minimal next tasks.

Issue Context:
- Current issue number: #{self.issue_number}
