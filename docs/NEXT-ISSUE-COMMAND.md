# Next Issue Command - Documentation

## Overview

The `./next-issue` command implements **Phase 1-2** of the [complete issue resolution workflow](./WORK-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md). It intelligently selects the next Step 1 issue to work on with a **two-phase workflow**:

**Note:** This command focuses on **selection and setup only**. For the complete workflow including context analysis, planning, implementation, testing, review, and PR creation, see [WORK-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md](./WORK-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md).

### Phase 1: Reconciliation (GitHub as Source of Truth)

- Checks GitHub for merged PRs and closes associated issues
- Verifies closed PRs have closed issues
- Updates local tracking documentation to match GitHub state
- Commits and syncs changes automatically
- Loops until everything is reconciled

### Phase 2: Selection

- Uses **sequential order from tracking file** (issues 24-58)
- Checks which blockers are resolved via GitHub API
- Selects the highest priority unblocked issue
- Adjusts time estimates based on historical learning

**Important:** GitHub is the single source of truth. Local tracking files are updated to match GitHub, never the other way around.

### Workflow Principles

When working through the complete workflow (Phases 3-6), follow these critical principles:

- **No hallucinations:** Verify everything with actual command output - never assume tests pass or builds succeed
- **Get approval for decisions:** Architecture and feature decisions require explicit user approval before proceeding
- **Complete all phases:** Work through entire 6-phase workflow - don't stop prematurely
- **Mandatory reviews:** Self-review (Step 7) and Copilot review are MANDATORY - never skip
- **Evidence-based verification:** All acceptance criteria must have actual evidence, not assumptions
- **Preserve existing features:** Never remove mature functionality without explicit user confirmation

## Installation

The command is already installed in the repository root. No setup needed.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# From repository root
./next-issue
```

This will:

1. **Reconcile** - Sync local docs with GitHub state
2. **Select** - Find next available issue
3. Display full issue details and next steps
4. Update the knowledge base with the selection

### Command Options

```bash
# Dry run (don't update knowledge base or commit changes)
./next-issue --dry-run

# Verbose output (show detailed GitHub API calls)
./next-issue --verbose

# Skip reconciliation (not recommended)
./next-issue --skip-reconcile

# Custom timeout (default: 180 seconds)
./next-issue --timeout 120
```

### Internal Timeout Handling

The script has **built-in timeout protection**:

- Default: 180 seconds for entire operation
- Configurable via `--timeout` flag
- Individual operations have sub-timeouts (10-15s)
- Graceful error handling on timeout
- No need for external `timeout` command

[Full issue details from tracking file]

🚀 Next Steps:
   1. Read the full issue on GitHub
   2. Create feature branch
   3. Follow Phase 2: Context & Planning (create detailed planning document)
   4. Continue through Phases 3-6 (see WORK-ISSUE-WORKFLOW.md)
================================================================================
```

### After Selection: Phase 2 - Context & Planning

Once an issue is selected, immediately proceed to Phase 2:

1. **Read Full Issue from GitHub**

   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <repo> --json body,title,labels,comments
   ```

2. **Create Planning Document** (`docs/issues/issue-<number>-context.md`)
   - Current state analysis
   - Required changes
   - Technical approach (GET USER APPROVAL for architecture decisions)
   - Step-by-step implementation plan (10+ specific steps)
   - Estimated time breakdown

3. **Key Success Factor:** The planning document saves 1-2 hours of implementation time by:
   - Reducing decision fatigue
   - Providing clear path from start to finish
   - Identifying dependencies and risks early
   - Creating checkpoints for progress tracking

**From Issue #25 Learning:** Creating a detailed planning document was the highest ROI activity - 30-45 minutes of planning saved significant implementation time.

### Verbose Mode

Shows detailed GitHub API calls, caching hits, and reconciliation steps for debugging.

## Recording Completions

After completing an issue, record the actual time spent to improve future estimates:

```bash
./scripts/record-completion.py <issue_number> <actual_hours> [notes]
```

Example:

```bash
./scripts/record-completion.py 24 7.5 "Tests took longer than expected due to mock adapter issues"
```

This will:

1. Record actual vs estimated time
2. Calculate time variance
3. Update the average time multiplier
4. Provide insights on why variance occurred
5. Improve future time estimates

## Learning System

The command uses a JSON knowledge base (`.issue-resolution-knowledge.json`) that tracks:

### Completed Issues

```json
{
  "issue_number": 24,
  "estimated_hours": 8.0,
  "actual_hours": 7.5,
  "multiplier": 0.94,
  "completed_at": "2026-01-18T15:30:00",
  "notes": "Tests took longer than expected"
}
```

### Patterns

```json
{
  "avg_time_multiplier": 1.15,
  "common_blockers": ["API integration issues", "Test setup complexity"],
  "success_factors": [
    "Clear acceptance criteria defined upfront",
    "Thorough self-review before user review (Step 7)",
    "Detailed planning document (docs/issues/issue-N-context.md) reduces implementation time",
    "Test-first approach prevents regressions and provides immediate feedback",
    "Phase commits enable clear progress tracking and easy rollback",
    "Copilot review catches UX issues beyond functional correctness"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Skipping Copilot self-review (Step 7)",
    "Starting work before blockers merged",
    "Removing existing features without user confirmation (always verify first)",
    "Assuming tests pass without actually running them",
    "Making architecture decisions without explicit user approval",
    "Stopping before completing all 6 phases of workflow"
  ]
}
```

### Time Estimate Adjustment

The command automatically adjusts estimates based on historical data:

- **Initial estimate**: 8.0 hours (from tracking plan)
- **Historical multiplier**: 1.15x (average actual/estimated)
- **Adjusted estimate**: 9.2 hours (8.0 × 1.15)

This helps set realistic expectations as the project progresses.

## Selection Algorithm

### Step 1: Reconciliation Phase

1. **Check Merged PRs**
   - Query GitHub for recently merged PRs (last 20)
   - Extract issue numbers from PR titles
   - Close issues if PRs are merged but issues still open

2. **Update Tracking File**
   - Query GitHub for all Step 1 issues (24-58)
   - Compare GitHub state with local tracking file
   - Update local file to match GitHub (source of truth)
   - Don't overwrite "In Progress" or "Complete" statuses

3. **Commit and Sync**
   - Commit tracking file changes to git
   - Push to remote repository
   - Loop until no changes detected

### Step 2: Issue Selection

1. **Parse Issues from GitHub**
   - Query issues 24-58 individually (no label assumptions)
   - Sequential order defined by tracking file
   - Uses caching to avoid repeated API calls

2. **Parse Tracking Metadata**
   - Extract estimated hours, blockers, phase from tracking file
   - Use fast, optimized regex patterns
   - Individual section parsing (not complex multi-line regex)

3. **Filter Available Issues**
   - Status must be "Open" on GitHub
   - All blockers must be resolved (verified via GitHub)
   - Blockers checked using merged PR verification

4. **Priority Sorting**
   - High/CRITICAL priority first
   - Then sequential order (24, 25, 26...)
   - Respects dependency chain

5. **Context Enrichment**
   - Extract full issue section from tracking file
   - Add historical insights from knowledge base
   - Calculate adjusted time estimates

6. **Display Recommendation**
   - Show selected issue with full context
   - Provide GitHub-verified next steps
   - Include learning insights

## Key Features

### 1. Reconciliation-First Approach

The command always reconciles before selection:

- **Why?** Ensures local docs match GitHub reality
- **How?** Queries GitHub for PR/issue states
- **Result:** No stale data, no manual sync needed

### 2. GitHub as Source of Truth

Never assumes local files are correct:

- Issue state comes from GitHub API
- Blocker resolution verified via merged PRs
- Tracking file updated to match GitHub

### 3. No Label Assumptions

Uses **sequential order** from tracking file (24-58):

- No reliance on GitHub labels
- Follows documented plan order exactly
- Resilient to label changes

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **API caching**: Avoids repeated queries
- **Optimized regex**: Fast tracking file parsing
- **Progress indicators**: Shows status during long operations
- **Individual queries**: More reliable than bulk queries

### 5. Production-Ready Error Handling

- Internal timeout protection (default 180s)
- Graceful degradation on network errors
- Clear error messages
- Proper exit codes (124=timeout, 130=interrupt)

The command is designed to work with the 10-step protocol:

```
Step 1: Pre-work Validation
  ↓
./next-issue  ← Use command here to select next issue
  ↓
Step 2: Create Feature Branch
  ↓
Step 3: Implementation
  ↓
...
  ↓
Step 10: Post-merge Validation
  ↓
./scripts/record-completion.py  ← Record completion here
  ↓
./next-issue  ← Select next issue
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No issues available to work on"

**Possible causes:**

- All issues are complete (check tracking plan)
- All remaining issues have unresolved blockers
- GitHub API rate limit reached

**Solutions:**

1. Check `STEP-1-IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKING.md` for status
2. Verify blockers are actually merged on GitHub
3. Wait for GitHub API rate limit to reset

### "Issue not found in tracking file"

**Cause:** Issue number doesn't exist in `STEP-1-IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKING.md`

**Solution:** Check issue number is between 24-58 (excluding 59)

### Import errors when running scripts

**Cause:** Python path issues

**Solution:** Run from repository root:

```bash
cd /home/sw/work/AI-Agent-Framework
./next-issue
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run after each merge** - Always use `./next-issue` after completing an issue
2. **Record completions** - Always use `record-completion.py` to track actual time
3. **Review insights** - Pay attention to historical patterns and success factors
4. **Follow recommendations** - The adjusted estimates are based on real data
5. **Update tracking plan** - Keep `STEP-1-IMPLEMENTATION-TRACKING.md` current
6. **Create planning documents** - Always create `docs/issues/issue-N-context.md` in Phase 2
7. **Never skip reviews** - Self-review and Copilot review are MANDATORY gates
8. **Verify everything** - Run actual commands, capture output, don't assume success
9. **Get approval for decisions** - Architecture and feature changes need user approval
10. **Complete all phases** - Don't stop until all 6 phases are finished and PR is created

### Real Example: Issue #25

**What worked:**

- Created detailed planning document → saved 1-2 hours implementation time
- Test-first approach → 12 tests caught issues early
- Self-review → caught critical chat removal issue before user review
- Copilot review → identified layout inconsistency improving UX
- Phase commits → clear progress, easy rollback

**Lessons learned:**

- Never remove existing features without confirmation (chat was mature, not demo)
- Planning time (30-45 min) pays off significantly in implementation
- Self-review (Step 7) is truly MANDATORY - catches critical mistakes
- Actual: 3.5 hours vs estimated 4.0 hours (-12.5%) thanks to good planning
