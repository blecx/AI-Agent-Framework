- **Time Estimates**: Approximate, assuming prerequisites met
- **Commands**: Copy-pasteable, tested in Docker environment
- **Expected Outputs**: JSON/HTML snippets show correct results
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions included

### Todo Application

- User authentication
- Task CRUD operations
- Task categorization
- Due date tracking
- Email notifications

This provides a realistic context for learning ISO 21500 concepts.

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Troubleshooting

Stuck? Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](shared/troubleshooting.md) for:

- Docker issues (ports, volumes, networking)
- API connection problems
- TUI command failures
- GUI not loading
- Git conflicts in projectDocs

### Community Support

- **GitHub Issues**: [Report bugs or ask questions](https://github.com/blecx/AI-Agent-Framework/issues)
- **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) (when services running)
- **Development Guide**: [docs/development.md](../development.md)

## ✅ Validation

All tutorials are validated with automated Playwright tests to ensure accuracy and catch regressions early. The validation suite runs 10 tests in ~51 seconds.

### Automated Validation (CI)

Tutorial validation tests run automatically on every PR via GitHub Actions CI pipeline:

- **Job**: `tutorial validation` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Marker**: `pytest -m tutorial_validation`
- **Runtime**: ~2 minutes (includes Docker startup)
- **Browsers**: Chromium via Playwright
- **Coverage**: GUI basics (4 tutorials), TUI basics (partial)

### Manual Validation

Run the validation suite locally to verify tutorials before committing changes:

```bash
# Full tutorial validation suite (recommended)
bash docs/tutorials/validation/test-runner.sh

# Quick validation (Playwright tests only)
pytest -m tutorial_validation -v

# Individual tutorial validation
pytest tests/e2e/tutorial/test_gui_basics.py::TestGUITutorial01WebInterface -v

# Specific test case
pytest tests/e2e/tutorial/test_gui_basics.py::TestGUITutorial01WebInterface::test_web_ui_loads -v
```

**Prerequisites for manual runs:**
- Docker services running (`docker compose up -d`)
- Python environment activated (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
- Playwright installed (`python -m playwright install chromium`)

### Validation Report

See [VALIDATION-REPORT.md](VALIDATION-REPORT.md) for:
- Latest test results and pass rates
- Known issues and workarounds
- Test coverage by tutorial
- Performance metrics

### Test Structure

Tutorial validation tests are organized by interface and difficulty:

```
tests/e2e/tutorial/
├── conftest.py              # Shared fixtures (Docker, Playwright)
├── test_gui_basics.py       # GUI tutorial validation (5 test classes)
├── test_tui_basics.py       # TUI tutorial validation (5 test classes)
└── test_advanced_workflows.py  # Advanced tutorial validation (3 test classes)
```

Each test class validates one tutorial end-to-end by:
1. Starting fresh Docker environment
2. Executing tutorial steps programmatically
3. Asserting expected UI elements or CLI outputs
4. Verifying artifacts created in `projectDocs/`

### Troubleshooting Validation Failures

**"Docker services not healthy"**
```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Should return 200
```

**"Playwright browser not found"**
```bash
python -m playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

**"Test timeout"**
- Increase timeout in `conftest.py` (default: 15s)
- Check system resources (Docker needs ~2GB RAM)

**"Element not found"**
- Tutorial may have changed but test wasn't updated
- Open issue with "tutorial" label
- Check [VALIDATION-REPORT.md](VALIDATION-REPORT.md) for known issues
