# Issue #478 Context (Split Placeholder Closeout)

## Summary
Issue #478 is an auto-generated split placeholder from #435 (which itself was a split placeholder from #425). The body contains only generic instructions to “Create issue C” and does not define any implementation or documentation requirements beyond the already-tracked planning/spec alignment work.

## Why this can be closed
- #478 contains no actionable scope beyond “create a follow-up slice”.
- The parent split chain (#425 → #435 → #478) was used to keep manual work under 20 minutes, and the planning/spec alignment request has already been captured elsewhere.
- Closing #478 reduces tracker noise and keeps the repository aligned to real, actionable work.

## Traceability
- Parent issue: #435 (closed)
- Root issue: #425
- Planning/spec alignment reference: `docs/issues/issue-437-context.md`
- Related closeouts in this chain:
  - Issue #476 closeout (PR #537)
  - Issue #477 closeout (PR #538)

## Validation
- Docs-only change.
- No runtime behavior impacted.
- No sensitive files touched (`projectDocs/`, `configs/llm.json`).
