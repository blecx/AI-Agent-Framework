        title: "Step 1: Define core agent interfaces and message schema"
        description: |
          Create the foundational interfaces for the agent framework so downstream features can build on a stable contract.

          Requirements:
          - Define core types/interfaces for Agent, Tool, Action/Command, Message, and Context.
          - Provide a minimal message schema (role, content, metadata, timestamps) and a validation strategy.
          - Document public API surface with inline docs.

          Acceptance Criteria:
          - Types/interfaces exist and are exported from the main package entrypoint.
          - Basic unit tests exist for schema validation (if applicable).
          - README or docs reference the new interfaces.

        title: "Step 1: Add baseline configuration and environment loading"
        description: |
          Implement a small configuration layer for the framework to standardize environment variables and runtime settings.

          Requirements:
          - Add config module with typed configuration object.
          - Load values from environment with sensible defaults.
          - Document required env vars.

          Acceptance Criteria:
          - Config can be imported and used by other modules.
          - Invalid/missing critical settings produce clear errors.

        title: "Step 1: Implement minimal tool runner with error handling"
        description: |
          Provide a minimal ToolRunner that can execute registered tools safely.

          Requirements:
          - Registry for tools by name.
          - Execute tool with validated inputs.
          - Standard error type for tool failures.

          Acceptance Criteria:
          - ToolRunner can register and run tools.
          - Errors are surfaced with consistent structure.
          - Example tool included.

        title: "Step 1: Create client SDK skeleton and package structure"
        description: |
          Scaffold the client SDK repository with a minimal package structure ready for implementation.

          Requirements:
          - Establish src/ layout and build tooling.
          - Export a public Client class placeholder.
          - Add basic lint/test configuration.

          Acceptance Criteria:
          - `npm test` (or equivalent) runs successfully.
          - Package builds and exports a module.

        title: "Step 1: Define client ↔ framework message contract types"
        description: |
          Define the shared message/command contract used between the client SDK and the agent framework.

          Requirements:
          - Mirror message schema types from the framework.
          - Add serialization/deserialization helpers.
          - Document compatibility expectations.

          Acceptance Criteria:
          - Types compile and are exported.
          - Simple tests cover serialization round-trip.

        title: "Step 1: Add example usage project/snippet"
        description: |
          Provide a minimal example showing how a consumer would use the client SDK to send messages/commands.

          Requirements:
          - Add example folder or README snippet.
          - Include basic initialization and one request/response flow.

          Acceptance Criteria:
          - Example is referenced from README.
          - Example builds/runs (if executable).
